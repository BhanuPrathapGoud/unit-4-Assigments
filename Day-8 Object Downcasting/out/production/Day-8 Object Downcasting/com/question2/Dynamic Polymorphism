Q2) Explain dynamic polymorphism ?

Dynamic Polymorphism is the process to achieve the overridden method on runtime not rather then compile time.
Dynamic Polymorphism polymorphism achieve by method overriding.

Ex : -

 take a two class;
 one is Bird and another is Parrot

 Class Bird{
 //this is parent method
    public void fly(){
            System.out. println("Bird is flying");
    }
 }
 inheritance Bird by parrot

  Class Parrot extends Bird{
    //Hear we can see the fly method is overridden
     public void fly(){
         System.out. println("Bird is Landing");
     }
     //this is child method
     public void sing(){
              System.out. println("Bird is Landing");
     }

  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args){
          Bird b1 = new Parrot();
          b1.fly();
          //when we call the fly method we can achieve the over ridden method
          Parrot b2 = (Parrot)b1;
         // to achieve the more methods from the child we have to do Down casting
          b2.sing();
      }

  }
