Q1)What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ?
explain with an example.

This :-
    "This" is reference variable that refers to the current object.
    this keyword can be used to refer current class instance variable and
     this keyword can also be used to return the current class instance.

    examples:-
     public class Student {
     //instance variable
         int roll;
         String name;
         String address;
         int marks;

         Student(){
            this.Student(String str);
         }
         Student(String str){
             this;
          }

         public void getData(int roll,String name,String address,int marks){
         //here This keyword refer to instance variable
            this.roll=roll;
            this.name=name;
            this.address address;
            this.marks = marks;
         }

     }


Super:-
It is used to access members of the base class.
super() is used to invoke immediate parent class method.

example:-

class car{
    test(){
    sout("I am car");
    }
}
class Honda extends car{
    test(){
        if(check == true){
        test.super()
        }
        else{
        sout("I am honda")
     }

}
