Question 2:
Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?

Method overloading:-
    it declaring same method  with different operation.
    the first priority of calling method with same is size of arguments;
    the second one is type of arguments which passing to method;
    And near to that object.

    Examples:-

    class Car{
    String name;
        public void main name(){ // method with zero arguments;
            name = "Honda"
            system.out.println(name)
        }
        public void main name(name){ // method with one String arguments;
                    this.name = name
                    system.out.println(name)
         }
         public void main name(name,cost){ // method with different String arguments;
                this.name = name
                system.out.println(name)
                system.out.println(cost)
          }
    }
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Method overriding:-

 it is over writing the method or action from lower casting to upper casting and upper casting to lower casting
 for this method super key word use to change the method

     class Car{
        String name;
            public void main name(){ // method with zero arguments
                system.out.println("I am Car")
            }

        }

     class Honda extends Car{
        String name;
            public void main name(){ // hear the name method has changed in subclass
                system.out.println("I am Honda car")
            }

        }
