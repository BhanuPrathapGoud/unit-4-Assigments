Differentiate between static and non-static variables?


Static variables :
 variables which is created on ram static part.
 it was in side class with static keyword.
 this variables can use any static methods.
 this are single variables/method object

 non Static variables :
 this variables are loaded in ram hook storage.
 this are not loaded until we call this variables.
 in class by  non Static variables we can create multiple objects.



 example :
 //non static
        String name;
     boolean isHungry;
     int age;

     //static
     static int totalDeaths;
