Q1) Write the difference between JRE, JDK and JVM?

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
JRE is an implementation of Jvm . with JRE we execute code in any operating System and JRE contains libraries and other files.

JDK (Java Development Kit)
This JDK software is used for developing and executing Java applications. This JDK contains JRE and  Development tools like java compiler, debugger, etc.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
JVM will help to convert java byte-code to understand all Operating System.with this architecture only, our java applications are portable or platform-independent.

Q2) Write the difference between JSE, JEE and JME?

 Java Standard Edition (JSE) : this is a core java platform which contains the core libraries to develop standalone, networking, database, GUI, multithreaded types of applications. the Java SE platform consists of the virtual machine, Day1: Java Introduction 2 development tools, deployment technologies and other class libraries and toolkit commonly used in Java application

Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) : it provides the api and runtime environment for developing and running large scale application, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications. 
Java Micro Edition (JME): It is a subset of Java SE, designed for microdevices and embedded development .

Q3) How does java achieve platform independency?

Java  is platform independent in that the Java source  code will be converted into byte-code and  we can execute code in any operating System . Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA)


Q4) What are features of Java and explain them?

OOPs
Simple
platform independency and portable
Secure 
Multithreaded
Robust
